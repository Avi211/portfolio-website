# portfolio-website
Developed a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS to professionally showcase my skills, projects, achievements, and contact information.
The design was clean and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
I demonstrated strong front-end development skills by creating a visually appealing and well-structured layout that enhances my professional online presence.
Additionally, I implemented effective navigation and UI elements to improve user interaction and accessibility for potential clients and employers.
